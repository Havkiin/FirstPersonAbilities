# Gameplay Abilities

This project encapsulates several gameplay abilities for a FPS character in Unreal Engine 5.

The abilities are encapsulated inside components, which can be added/removed from the character easily.

## Telekinesis

The [Telekinesis Component](Source/AreWeBackReloaded/TelekinesisComponent.cpp) is a simple telekinesis ability, which allows you to pick up and move around blocks, and throw them in a direction.

Press Left Click to move the object around, and Right Click to throw it.

## Blink

The [Blink Component](Source/AreWeBackReloaded/BlinkComponent.cpp) is a Blink ability, similar to the one from _Dishonored_, which teleports you to a set location.

Press and hold Right Click to pick a teleport location, and release to teleport.
